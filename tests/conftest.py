"""Load ``session`` without a Home Assistant install.

Importing it through the package would run ``custom_components/ugreen_connect_plus/__init__.py``,
which pulls in Home Assistant. The session logic is deliberately free of those imports, so
the module is compiled straight from its source text -- which also fails loudly the moment
someone adds a Home Assistant import to it.

The source is compiled here rather than imported so that ``__pycache__`` is never
consulted: two edits a second apart that leave the file the same length look unchanged
to the bytecode cache, and the tests would then run against the previous version.
